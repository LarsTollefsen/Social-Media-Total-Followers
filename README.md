# Social-Media-Total-Followers
Gets the total social media followers count from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitch and Twitter using Python. Small, quick and simple project to have the total stats more readily available. Does not use the Facebook API, but instead a manual input for the followers, since the API will only give out total likes and not followers. Export function connects to a spreadsheet and inserts the row into the first row with date, time and all the statistics.

## Getting Started

Clone (or download) the project. It's important that you do not change the folder structure without changing it in the code as well. 

### Prerequisites

Use pip to install the missing libraries used in the project(ex. Tweepy). See the import list and what you're missing.

## The different parts and how to make them work

I will now list the different sections that's been divided with comments with instructions of what needs changing when needed. Use this as both an explanation of the script and documentation. Decided to do it this way because of the simplicity and size of the script.
